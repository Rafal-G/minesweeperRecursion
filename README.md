Traverse a minesweeper board recursively.

This code will traverse a "board" recursively, the board is hard coded at the start of the file mines are represented
with an M const and empty spaces are represented with a _.

There are further comments in the code, run with `node .\minesweeper.js`.

There are still probably some optimizations I could do however I really wanted to time box myself.
